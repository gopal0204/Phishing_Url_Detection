# Phishing-URL-Detection
Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers create fake websites or emails that appear to be from a legitimate source to trick victims into providing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information.

Phishing URL detection is the process of identifying and flagging URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) that are associated with phishing attacks. This can be done through a variety of methods including:

Blacklisting:
      Maintaining a list of known phishing URLs and blocking access to them. This approach is effective but relies on keeping the blacklist up-to-date.

Machine Learning: 
      Using algorithms like Decision Tree classifier and Random Forest classifier to analyze URLs and identify patterns that are common in phishing URLs. This approach can be more proactive in detecting new phishing URLs but requires training data and ongoing monitoring.

Reputation-based systems: 
      Using reputation scores to evaluate the trustworthiness of URLs. This approach considers factors such as the age of the domain, the history of the website, and the behavior of the website's users.

Phishing URL detection is an important part of protecting against phishing attacks. By detecting and blocking phishing URLs, organizations can prevent their users from falling victim to these types of attacks and protect sensitive information
